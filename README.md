After thorough scrutiny of the functioning of the Indian Education System, I may have managed to find the reason for the inability of the system to create great thinkers for our society. 
Diversity in Thought, Ideas and Beliefs is the fundamental element in the functioning of democracy and any type of problem solving. 
Reformations and Revolutions that had come about until now, are all indicators of the power of thinking differently and looking at systems with different eyes, eyes that are rational and critical. 
Solving Real World Problems through jobs or businesses, also requires the ability to think and come up with solutions. 

Thus, we have to acknowledge the importance of diversity of thought in the fundamental functioning of any given society. 

Education system, in the first place, was created to inculcate this habit of thinking into children. They would be taught to think about the fundamental flaws of the society and find ways to overcome them (and hopefully make some money in the process), but this system changed into a "employee-producing" factory that produces at mass, workers with uniform skills and ideas. 
This system might be a direct result of industrialization in the 19th and the 20th century and the need for huge workforce. The main objective of schools then, was to produce obedient, uniform minded and hardworking laborers.

However, now it's completely different due to the introduction of various technologies for automating various repetitive tasks. Moreoever, AI is furthermore, posing a serious threat to many jobs.
